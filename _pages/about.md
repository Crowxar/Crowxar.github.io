I am still setting things up around here - but tldr - I'm a hobbiest, just started learning code in late 2023. Started with Python and then moved onto SQL. Right now I am learning the ins and outs of tkinter and ttkbootstrap, as well as basic software development. 

My main project right now that I am working on is called my ["Personal Toolkit Repository"](https://github.com/Crowxar/PersonalToolbox). The idea is that there will be python based tools inside it that I can use to help further develop other apps. Things like tkinter refrences, color pallet generators, and other stuff. Think of it as an open ended project that I can use to just really dig my teeth into learning basic GUI development and further my Python code structuring. 

I have other projects I plan on starting in the future, but for now we're just going to work this.

Feel free to reach out to me via Discord - link is on the left. I'm chronically online and love to talk. This website is a clone of the academicpages template, they do some great work and I am looking forward to personalizing and participating in this community!
